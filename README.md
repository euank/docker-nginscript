# nginscript

See [this blog](https://www.nginx.com/blog/launching-nginscript-and-looking-ahead/) and [this documentation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/nginScript/) for what this is.

I followed what was in the doc's installation instructions roughly.

## Usage

Bindmount your configuration into `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` and off
you go. Yes, I know the directory is awkward, deal.
